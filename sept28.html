    <h1>Thank you for visiting flosspics2 on September 28th <br> this is a daily update</h1>
    <p>I went on a long run today. I ran past a really great smell - like the perfumed hair of a barbie doll and cigs. I think it came from inside of a car. Intoxicating! <br> In the afternoon, I did one of the most expensive things a person can do: get something custom framed. The something was a pen and ink drawing my grandfather had done as a teenager. I did spring for the no glare, UV protective museum glass. <br> Then, I needed to spend more money. I bought this carpenters record because I don't have it. Those siblings really did know their way around a ballad. And no one has a better logo. I wonder if you ever think about the carpenters. I hope you do, but it's ok if you don't. <br>
